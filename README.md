# ChatMini

**ChatMini** is a small-scale chat application I built to deepen my understanding of **real-time communication with Socket.IO**, **Docker-based development**, and other essential backend concepts.

The goal of this project isn’t just to have a working chat app—it’s to explore how modern backend systems handle **real-time events**, **authentication**, and **persistent data**, all while maintaining a structure that can **scale in the future**.

By building ChatMini, I aimed to:

- **Learn how to implement real-time messaging** with Socket.IO.
- **Understand user authentication and session management** in a live system.
- **Get hands-on experience with Docker** for creating isolated, reproducible environments.
- **Practice connecting frontend and backend flows** in a practical project.

This repo serves as both a **learning experiment** and a **reference** for anyone interested in understanding the core mechanics of a real-time chat system.
